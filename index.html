		<h2>Welcome!</h2>


		<p>I'm Taylor, a junior studying news reporting at the Missouri School of Journalism. I'm passionate about telling stories that impact people and communities through careful, thorough reporting.</p>

		<img width="255px" height="382px" style="float:right; padding-left:15px; padding-bottom:15px" src="Media/Headshot.jpg">

		<p>I've reported for the <a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/users/profile/blatchfordtr/" target="_blank">Columbia Missourian</a>, a daily city newspaper, since summer 2016. I've covered a variety of local topics as a general assignment reporter, but I'm especially interested in covering education, health and public safety. I enjoy breaking down complex policies and making them understandable and relevant for readers. I also love using data to tell stories with graphics.</p>

		<p>Last school year, I served as the university news editor for <a href="http://www.themaneater.com/staff/view/taylor-blatchford/" target="_blank">The Maneater</a>, MU's student newspaper. I led our publication's coverage of a tumultuous fall 2015 semester that made national news when race-based student protests led to two top-level administrative resignations. Another reporter and I documented the semester's events with an <a href="http://www.themaneater.com/special-sections/mu-fall-2015/" target="_blank">interactive timeline</a>, which received over 200,000 views and has been cited by national outlets.</p>

		<p>I've reported on a variety of issues pertaining to MU, including race relations, administrative transitions and sexual assault. I was previously The Maneater's projects editor, where I oversaw and planned multimedia projects and in-depth stories. I've also designed graphics, copy edited and taken photos for the publication.</p>

		<p>Scholastic journalism has a special place in my heart &mdash; I fell in love with journalism in high school and believe that the skills students learn in that environment are applicable to any field. I've traveled to national high school journalism conventions around the country to teach high school students, and for the past two summers I've led a team of students in a weeklong multimedia journalism workshop at Stanford University.</p>

		<p style="margin-bottom: 110px">In my free time, I love spending time outside, reading and experimenting with cooking things besides my all-time favorite food, mac and cheese.</p>
