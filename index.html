		<h2>Welcome!</h2>


		<p>I'm Taylor, a junior studying news reporting at the Missouri School of Journalism. I'm passionate about telling stories that impact people and communities through careful, thorough reporting.</p>

		<img width="270px" height="404px" style="float:right; padding-left:15px; padding-bottom:15px" src="Media/Headshot.jpg">

		<p>Right now, I'm working for <a href="http://www.politico.eu/">POLITICO Europe</a>as a production intern in Brussels, Belgium. I manage social media accounts, produce stories for the web and assist with design.</p>

		<p>Most recently, I reported for the <a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/users/profile/blatchfordtr/" target="_blank">Columbia Missourian</a>, a daily city newspaper in my college town. I've covered a variety of local news topics, but much of my reporting focused on education, public safety and health.</p> 

		<p>My favorite part of reporting is digging into complex topics and making them understandable and accessible for readers &mdash; something Iâ€™ve done on issues including civil and criminal court cases, school accreditation reports and police interviewing programs. I enjoy breaking down data and public records to enrich my reporting, and I also love telling stories with graphics.</p>

		<p>I served as the university news editor for <a href="http://www.themaneater.com/staff/view/taylor-blatchford/" target="_blank">The Maneater</a>, MU's student newspaper, for the 2015-16 school year. I led our publication's coverage of a tumultuous fall 2015 semester that made national news when race-based student protests led to two top-level administrative resignations. Another reporter and I documented the semester's events with an <a href="http://www.themaneater.com/special-sections/mu-fall-2015/" target="_blank">interactive timeline</a>, which received over 200,000 views and was cited by national outlets. Prior to that, I edited multimedia projects, reported and designed graphics for the publication.</p>

		<p>Scholastic journalism has a special place in my heart &mdash; I fell in love with journalism in high school and believe that the skills students learn in that environment are applicable to any field. I've traveled to national high school journalism conventions around the country to teach high school students, and for the past two summers I've led a team of students in a weeklong multimedia journalism workshop at Stanford University.</p>

		<p style="margin-bottom: 110px">In my free time, I love spending time outside, reading and experimenting with cooking things besides my all-time favorite food, mac and cheese.</p>
