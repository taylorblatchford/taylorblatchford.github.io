		<h2>Welcome!</h2>


		<p>I'm Taylor, a junior at the Missouri School of Journalism. I'm studying news reporting because I'm passionate about telling stories that can impact communities and people's lives through careful, thorough reporting.</p>

		<img width="255px" height="382px" style="float:right;" src="Media/Headshot.jpg">

		<p>I'm currently reporting for the <a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/users/profile/blatchfordtr/" target="_blank">Columbia Missourian</a>, a daily city newspaper. I cover a variety of local topics as a general assignment reporter, but I'm especially interested in covering education. I enjoy breaking down complex policies and making them understandable and relevant for readers.</p>

		<p>This past year, I served as the university news editor for <a href="http://www.themaneater.com/staff/view/taylor-blatchford/" target="_blank">The Maneater</a>, MU's student newspaper. In fall 2015, I led our publication's coverage of a tumultuous semester that made national news when race-based student protests led to two top-level administrative resignations. Another reporter and I created an <a href="http://www.themaneater.com/special-sections/mu-fall-2015/" target="_blank">interactive timeline</a> of the semester's events, which has been cited by national outlets and received over 200,000 views.</p>

		<p>I've reported on a variety of issues pertaining to the university over the past two years, including race relations, administrative transitions and sexual assault. I was previously The Maneater's projects editor, where I oversaw and planned multimedia projects and in-depth stories. I've also designed graphics, copy edited and taken photos for the publication.</p>

		<p>Scholastic journalism has a special place in my heart &mdash; I fell in love with journalism in high school and believe that the skills students learn in that environment are applicable to any field. I've traveled to national high school journalism conventions around the country to teach high school students, and for the past two summers I've led a team of students in a weeklong multimedia journalism workshop at Stanford University.</p>

		<p>In my free time, I love spending time outside, reading novels and experimenting with cooking things besides my all-time favorite food, mac and cheese.</p>
