			<p class="description">After MU's chancellor and system president resigned just hours apart following race-based student protests, our staff created a special online issue. I wrote two news stories, edited other stories and assisted in planning the issue and selecting visuals.</p>

			<p class="description">One of my reporters worked for months to uncover the secrecy behind the search for former UM System President Tim Wolfe.
